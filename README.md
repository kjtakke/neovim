Would you like this as a downloadable cheat sheet, or shall I include plugin/mapping info as well?

##### You said:

how do I have multiple tabs and what are teh commands

###### ChatGPT said:

In **Neovim**, you can open and manage **multiple tabs** using **tab pages**, which are essentially collections of windows (splits). Each tab can have its own layout of splits, buffers, etc.

Here‚Äôs a handy table of all the standard **tab commands**:

* * *

### üß∑ **Basic Tab Commands**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `:tabnew` | Open a new tab |
| `:tabnew <file>` | Open a file in a new tab |
| `:tabclose` | Close the current tab |
| `:tabonly` | Close all other tabs |
| `:tabs` | List all tabs and their contents |

* * *

### üîÅ **Navigating Tabs**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `gt` or `:tabn` | Go to next tab |
| `gT` or `:tabp` | Go to previous tab |
| `:tabfirst` | Go to the first tab |
| `:tablast` | Go to the last tab |
| `:tabnext <N>` | Go to tab number N |

* * *

### üéØ **Moving Tabs**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `:tabmove <N>` | Move current tab to position N (0-indexed) |

* * *

### üñ•Ô∏è **Tips**

- Tabs are not buffers: each tab can contain multiple splits, each with its own buffer.
    
- Combine with splits: e.g., `:tabnew | split` gives you a split in a new tab.
    
- To keep tabs visible: you might want to set `set showtabline=2` in your config to always show the tabline.
    

Would you like key mappings to make tab switching even faster (e.g., `<Leader>tn` for next tab)?

##### You said:

what about spliting tabs to have multiple windos and terminal

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! In **Neovim**, you can split tabs into **multiple windows**, and even open **terminals** within those splits. Here's how it all works:

* * *

### ü™ü **Splitting Windows (in a Tab)**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `:split` / `:sp` | Horizontal split (same file) |
| `:vsplit` / `:vsp` | Vertical split (same file) |
| `:split <file>` | Horizontal split and open file |
| `:vsplit <file>` | Vertical split and open file |

You can also use these in combination, e.g.:

vim

CopyEdit

`:vsp myfile.txt`

* * *

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è **Navigating Between Splits**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl-w h` | Move to split left |
| `Ctrl-w l` | Move to split right |
| `Ctrl-w j` | Move to split below |
| `Ctrl-w k` | Move to split above |
| `Ctrl-w w` | Cycle to the next window |
| `Ctrl-w q` | Quit a split |

* * *

### üìè **Resizing Splits**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl-w >` | Increase width (vertical split) |
| `Ctrl-w <` | Decrease width |
| `Ctrl-w +` | Increase height (horizontal split) |
| `Ctrl-w -` | Decrease height |
| `Ctrl-w =` | Equalise all splits |

* * *

### üñ•Ô∏è **Opening Terminals in Splits**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `:terminal` | Open terminal in current split |
| \`:split | terminal\` |
| \`:vsplit | terminal\` |

Once in a terminal:

- Press `Ctrl-\ Ctrl-n` to exit terminal **insert mode** and return to normal mode.
    
- Use `i` or `a` to go back into terminal input mode.
    

* * *

### üßº **Closing Splits and Tabs**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `:q` | Close current window/split |
| `:qa` | Quit all tabs and windows |
| `:tabclose` | Close current tab |

* * *

Would you like a keybinding setup to streamline these actions (e.g., shortcuts for split + terminal)?

##### You said:

quit without saving changes

###### ChatGPT said:

To **quit Neovim without saving changes**, use:

less

CopyEdit

`:q!`

This force-quits the current window or tab, **discarding any unsaved changes**.

* * *

### Additional Variants:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `:q!` | Quit current window without saving |
| `:qa!` | Quit **all** windows and tabs, no saves |
| `ZQ` | Same as `:q!` (shorthand from normal mode) |

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a full "save & quit" cheat sheet too.

##### You said:

open file by path :open ~/.bashrc

###### ChatGPT said:

In **Neovim**, to open a file by its path, including hidden files like `~/.bashrc`, you should **use `:edit` instead of `:open`**:

bash

CopyEdit

`:e ~/.bashrc`

or

bash

CopyEdit

`:edit ~/.bashrc`

### Why not `:open`?

- `:open` is a legacy Vim command and not commonly used.
    
- `:e` is the modern and recommended way to open files by path.
    

* * *

### Handy Notes:

- Use tab completion:  
    Type `:e ~/.ba<Tab>` to auto-complete `.bashrc`.
    
- To reload the file (discard changes):
    
    ruby
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `:e!`
    

Let me know if you want a shortcut or mapping to quickly open config files like `.vimrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.

##### You said:

how to name a tab

###### ChatGPT said:

In **Neovim**, there isn‚Äôt a built-in command to "name" a tab like you would in a browser. Tabs in Neovim represent layouts of windows (splits), and their labels are usually just the filenames of the buffers they contain.

However, you can **simulate named tabs** using a few tricks:

* * *

### üß† Option 1: Use a Scratch Buffer with a Title

You can open a new tab and create a buffer with a title, like so:

vim

CopyEdit

`:tabnew:enew | file [MyTabName]:setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=hide noswapfile`

This creates an empty, non-file buffer named `[MyTabName]`, which appears in the tab label.

* * *

### üõ† Option 2: Use a Plugin (Recommended)

For easier tab naming and more functionality, consider using a plugin:

#### üîπ [vim-taboo](https://github.com/gcmt/taboo.vim)

Lets you name and persist tab names:

vim

CopyEdit

`:TabooRename MyTabName`

#### üîπ [barbar.nvim](https://github.com/romgrk/barbar.nvim)

A beautiful tabline/bufferline plugin that can show file names and icons ‚Äî great for workflow.

* * *

### üí° Extra Tip: Rename Buffers (Affects Tab Title)

Renaming the buffer also affects what appears in the tab title:

vim

CopyEdit

`:saveas MyTabName.txt`

Or for scratch buffers:

vim

CopyEdit

`:file MyTabName`

* * *

Would you like me to set up a Lua config snippet for one of these tabline plugins?

##### You said:

can I run a bash comand on a current file dir liek the below as an intent i e i' in a file and I want to run: :term tail myfile.txt

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, absolutely! You can run a **bash command in the current file‚Äôs directory** using Neovim‚Äôs `:terminal` (or `:term`) command, and you can dynamically reference the current file‚Äôs path.

Here‚Äôs how to do what you described:

* * *

### ‚úÖ Run a terminal command from the current file‚Äôs directory

If you're editing a file (say, `~/projects/logs/myfile.txt`), and you want to `tail` that file **from its directory**, use:

vim

CopyEdit

`:term cd %:p:h && tail %:t`

#### üß† Explanation:

- `%` ‚Üí current file's path
    
- `%:p` ‚Üí full path
    
- `%:p:h` ‚Üí head (directory of the file)
    
- `%:t` ‚Üí tail (filename only)
    
- `cd %:p:h` ‚Üí change into the file‚Äôs directory
    
- `tail %:t` ‚Üí run `tail` on the file
    

* * *

### üí° Examples:

vim

CopyEdit

`:term cd %:p:h && ls -lah:term cd %:p:h && grep "error" %:t:term cd %:p:h && python3 %:t`

* * *

### ü™Ñ Mapping it for quick use (optional)

To make this easier, you can map a command in your `init.vim` or Lua config (let me know which you're using). For example:

vim

CopyEdit

`command! TailHere term cd %:p:h && tail %:t`

Then in Neovim, just run:

vim

CopyEdit

`:TailHere`

Want help mapping this to a keybinding or adding a few more handy terminal commands?
