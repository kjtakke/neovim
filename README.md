### üñ•Ô∏è **Tips**

- Tabs are not buffers: each tab can contain multiple splits, each with its own buffer.
    
- Combine with splits: e.g., `:tabnew | split` gives you a split in a new tab.
    
- To keep tabs visible: you might want to set `set showtabline=2` in your config to always show the tabline.
